# Squad-Up
Squad-Up is a data visualization tool that allows users to determine where the largest number of fans of a particular sports team there are in the United States based on live tweets of that team. This was inspired by the growing popularity of soccer in the U.S. and determining where the highest concentration of fans of a particular soccer team were located in the country.
